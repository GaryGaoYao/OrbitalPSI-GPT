## 🧠 System Overview

OrbitalPSI-GPT is a conversational, clinician-in-the-loop framework that uses natural language instructions to drive the complete design workflow for orbital patient-specific implants (PSIs). The system is designed to reduce dependence on proprietary software and specialised engineering support, lowering the expertise, software, and cost barriers to PSI design, particularly in resource-limited settings.
