## 📂 Data Availability & Disclaimer
**Important Note regarding the `.stl` files provided in this repository:**

The 3D mesh files included in this project are intended **solely for reproducibility and demonstration purposes**.

* **Privacy & Ethics**: These files do **not** contain data from the actual clinical patients included in our study/paper.
* **Origin**: All meshes are derived from publicly available **open-source medical imaging datasets**.
* **Preprocessing**: To facilitate code execution and ensure topological consistency for the Scalismo pipeline, the raw data was segmented and post-processed using **smoothing algorithms** (e.g., Laplacian smoothing) to remove artifacts and optimize mesh quality.

These models are provided to help users run the example scripts immediately without needing access to restricted clinical data.
